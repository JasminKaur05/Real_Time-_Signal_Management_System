_**🚦 Real-Time Signal Management System**_

A smart traffic management system that dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle detection. This project aims to reduce traffic congestion, waiting time, fuel consumption, and improve overall traffic flow at intersections.

_**📌 Project Overview**_

Traditional traffic signals work on fixed timing, which often leads to unnecessary congestion. This project introduces a rule-based intelligent traffic signal system that adjusts green light duration according to the number of vehicles detected at an intersection.

The system simulates vehicle detection using sensors and modifies traffic light timings dynamically for better traffic management.

_**🎯 Objectives**_

Detect vehicles in real time

Count the number of vehicles at an intersection

Dynamically adjust signal timing based on traffic density

Reduce congestion and waiting time

Improve traffic flow efficiency

_**🛠️ Technologies Used**_

Programming Language: C

Concepts Used:

Conditional statements

Loops

Functions

Sensor-based vehicle detection logic

Platform: Console-based application

_**⚙️ System Workflow**_

Detect vehicles using sensor input

Count the total number of vehicles

Adjust green signal duration based on vehicle count

Follow traffic signal sequence:

Green Light

Yellow Light

Red Light

Repeat the cycle continuously

_**⏱️ Signal Timing Logic**_
Vehicle Count	Green Light Duration
0 vehicles	5 seconds
1 – 5 vehicles	10 seconds
6 – 15 vehicles	20 seconds
More than 15	30 seconds

Yellow light: 5 seconds
Red light: 10 seconds
